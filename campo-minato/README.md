Campo Minato / Minefield

This project aims to recreate the popular game "Minefield" generating a grid based on the difficulty.

It has been developed with NextJs and Supabase, so you will need to understand the basis to easly navigate the files.

To make it run on your machine you will need to have npm installed, then run the command - npm install - in the root direcory.
At this point you will need to create a file .env, with the same fields present in the example.env file provided.
You will thus need a Supbase project URL and key, besides a gemini api key to make sure everything work just fine.
At this point, after having set up the file, you will just need to execute - npm run dev- in the root directory to make the project run.
A fully functional demo is avaiable at https://campo-minato-omega.vercel.app/
